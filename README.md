Hi there!

This is my first web-app. I combined drag and drop techniques with my passion for making instrumentals and love for visual design.

Takeaways:

1. Have a clear, well-defined goal.
2. Donâ€™t be afraid to try other ideas. I can always come back to an older version with proper version control.
3. Have fun and be creative.

Enjoy!
